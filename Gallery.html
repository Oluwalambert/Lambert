       <b>20. Lamborghini Urus Performante.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$270,000 <br>
    <img src="Car Image 20.jpg" alt="Img 20"><br>
    The Lamborghini Urus set the bar high when it was revealed in 2018. Now, it is seeking to reclaim its position as the world’s most dynamic SUV, with the new edition appropriately named Performante. While the power has only been raised slightly to 657 hp, everything else has been considerably upgraded and modified. The result is a lightning-fast SUV which can go from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds, along with sharper handling, braking, and driving dynamics. The design has different trim, color, and wheel choices, and is more lightweight. <br>
    <br>
       <b>19. Range Rover SV Carmel Edition.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$345,000 <br>
    <img src="Car Image 19.jpg" alt="Img 19"><br>
    The brand-new Range Rover might look like the outgoing model but is, in fact, an all-new car based on a new platform, with elegant body panels and an incredibly luxurious interior. The company knows just how important this nameplate is and has done its best to present a shape that is recognizable and modern at the same time. For the most discerning buyers, JLR has presented the Range Rover SV Carmel Edition, which is the ultimate luxury SUV. The power comes from a twin-turbo V8 with 523 hp, which gives this Range Rover a very confident performance. But what really gives this model the edge is the long-wheel-base chassis, exclusive four-seat arrangement, finest materials, unique color choices, and trim pieces, all of which justify the asking price. <br>

       <b>18. RUF Bergmeister.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$700,000 <br>
    <img src="Car Img 18.jpg" alt="Img 18"><br>
    There are many Porsche 911-based restomods overcrowding the supercar market. However, of all the new car manufacturers, there is one name that has been in the business of making fast Porsches even faster since 1975. RUF is known for its unique approach, technical expertise, and exclusivity, which is why its latest creation has stirred up so much interest. The RUF Bergmeister has just been revealed as its lightest and most agile creation yet. Based on the 993 generation of Porsche 911, the Bergmeister has a unique roadster design, body panels, and engine upgraded to 450 hp. Even though it doesn’t sound like much, it’s worth bearing in mind that the overall weight is under 2,425 pounds, making the Bergmeister extraordinarily dynamic and fun to drive. <br>
    <br>
       <b>17. Aston Martin Valhalla.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$800,000 <br>
    <img src="Car Img 17.jpg" alt="Img 17"><br>
    The Valhalla represents a new period in Aston Martin’s history. It symbolizes the company’s unique vision, relentless quest for speed and performance, and attempt to claim the throne in the supercar sector. The Valhalla is nothing short of remarkable, with its fantastic design, advanced technology, and jaw-dropping performance. The 4.0-liter twin-turbo paired with a hybrid drivetrain delivers 1,000 hp, and this tremendous model is guaranteed to set the sector’s already-lofty standards even higher. <br>
    <br>
       <b>16. DeTomaso P72.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$1.25 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 16.jpg" alt="Img 16"><br>
    One of the sports car legends that history has neglected is DeTomaso, an Italian company that produced some of the most exciting cars of the 70s. Recently revived by a Hong Kong investment group, DeTomaso is set to claim its position on the market with a magnificent P72, which combines supercharged V8 power with an Italian retro-futuristic design. The P72 has a carbon monocoque chassis and lots of trick racing technology, and its 5.0-liter V8 delivers over 700 hp. Interestingly, the only transmission option is a 6-speed manual, which makes the car closely aligned with its roots. Only 72 will be built, and this unique creation is on sale now. <br>
    <br>
       <b>15. McLaren Senna.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$1.6 million <br>
    <img src="Car img 15.jpg" alt="Img 15"><br>
    If you are a motorsport enthusiast, then the name Senna will conjure up not only the F1 driver but his legacy, too. Senna stands for perfection, dedication, and the art of driving, as well as sportsmanship and character. This was precisely the idea behind the McLaren Senna. It is not just a fantastic homage to the legendary Ayrton Senna but an incredibly well-designed and engineered supercar. With 768 hp behind the driver, track-ready suspension, lightweight construction, and equally impressive performance, the $1.6 million McLaren Senna is the pinnacle of supercar driving. <br>
    <br>
       <b>14. Koenigsegg Gemera.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$1.6 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 14.jpg" alt="Img 14"><br>
    Koenigsegg has become one of the leading names in the automotive industry, raising the bar for design, technology, and performance. The Gemera is the latest model, which features a hybrid drivetrain along with a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with just three cylinders. Even though the layout might not sound impressive, the results are astonishing. The Gemera delivers 1,700 hp, can sprint to 60 mph in just over 2 seconds and costs $1.6 million. We can expect to see it on the road next year. <br>
    <br>
       <b>13. Aston Martin DBR22.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$1.8 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 13.jpg" alt="Img 13"><br>
    Even though Aston Martin has set its sights on the future with advanced models like the Valhalla or Valkyrie, there is still a part of this company that draws inspiration from nostalgia. The latest bespoke creations by the company’s Q department are in this very category, inspired by glorious open racers from the 50s, which dominated the scene and eventually won the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 2023 Aston Martin DBR22 is a modern recreation of that concept. It is powered by a 5.2-liter V12 engine and supported by two turbochargers, delivering 705 hp and astonishing performance. With the superb design, extraordinary firepower under the hood, and very limited production run, this is one of the most sought-after cars of the 2022/2023 model year. <br>
    <br>
       <b>12. Rimac Nevera.</b> <br>
       <b>Price:</b>$2 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 12.jpg" alt="Img 12"> <br>
    The Croatian supercar wonder, Rimac, burst onto the scene with an exotic name, futuristic technology, and striking performance. Its latest contender, the Nevera, follows the same formula and delivers almost 2,000 hp to all four wheels from its all-electric drivetrain. It can accelerate to 60 mph in 1.84 seconds and reach top speeds of 256 mph. Such impressive figures more than justify the price tag, and the Nevera is rightfully among the most expensive electric cars on the market at $2 million. <br>
    <br>
       <b>11. Pagani Utopia.</b> <br>
       <b>Price:</b>$2.19 million <br> 
    <img src="Car img 11.jpg" alt="Img 11"><br>
    Throughout its history, Pagani has only made two distinct models (albeit numerous versions of each), so the introduction of its third model is big news. The Pagani Utopia is an all-new hypercar, which is set to be the next chapter in the manufacturer’s unique saga. With a modern design, fantastic interior, and incredible attention to detail, the Utopia is the successor of the Huayra. As in the past, Pagani has turned to Mercedes for its choice of power plants, and behind the driver is a new, twin-turbocharged, 6.0-liter Mercedes-AMG V12, which delivers 864 hp to the rear wheels. Pagani uses race-proven Xtrac automatic or manual transmissions to emphasize the performance. The company has hinted that track-only and special versions may be coming soon. <br>
    <br>
       <b>10. Ferrari Daytona SP3.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$2.25 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 10.jpg" alt="Img 10"><br>
    What is more tempting than a Ferrari? A special edition and limited-run Ferrari with body work inspired by legendary models is precisely what the Daytona SP3 offers. Set to debut in 2023, it is powered by a 6.5-liter V12 engine with 840 hp and will most certainly offer incredible performance levels. This stunning model will complement the rare models currently in production, with a naturally-aspirated engine accompanied by a thundering engine roar. The production run will be limited to 599 units, and the models are ready to reserve if you have $2.25 million to hand. <br>
    <br>
       <b>9. Lamborghini Countach LPI 800-4.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$2.64 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 9.jpg" alt="Img 9"><br>
    If you want to be one of 112 lucky owners who are due to assume ownership of a fantastic new Lamborghini, $2.5 million will get you the base model before any customizations. The LPI 800-4 is the latest model from Bologna, which is inspired by the legendary Countach, everybody’s favorite supercar from the 70s and 80s. It might have classic lines, but it will be equipped with modern technology and a hybrid-assisted V12 engine borrowed from the Sián hypercar. The “800” in its name relates to the horsepower output, while the “4” signifies that it is a four-wheel-drive. <br>
    <br>
       <b>8. Bentley Mulliner Batur.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$2.8 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 8.jpg" alt="Img 8"><br>
    Bentley, as a company, is at a historic turning point, given that it is moving towards the complete electrification of its lineup. The next generation of the best-selling Continental GT will be one of its first fully electric cars when it comes on sale in the near future. In the meantime, the company has decided to present a very special and exciting model called Mulliner Batur. With unique design and utterly different bodywork and details, Batur is a highly exclusive and immensely powerful GT cruiser of the highest order. It gets a top version of the eponymous W12 engine, which delivers 729 hp and impressive performance. And, of course, the interior is fully redone in the characteristic Bentley style. <br>
    <br>
       <b>7. Hennessey Venom F5.</b><br>
       <b>Price.</b>$3 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 7.jpg" alt="Img 7"><br>
    Even though it is European models that have tended to feature among the most expensive cars of 2022, there is also a solid contender from the States. Incidentally, this model is also the most expensive American car in production. The Hennessey Venom F5 is well-known for its incredible firepower as well as its high price tag. Powered by a twin-turbo V8, the Venom F5 delivers an amazing 1,800 hp and can reach a top speed of 249 mph. The production run is set to 24 cars, and if you want to be a proud owner of this American beauty, the asking price is $3 million. <br>
    <br>
       <b>6. Lamborghini Sián FKP37.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$3.5 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 6.jpg" alt="Img 6"><br>
    Behind this strange name is the next-generation Lamborghini hypercar. Powered by hybrid technology, which includes a V12 engine and electric motor with a combined output of 819 hp, the Sián is the successor of the Aventador line, but with a twist. The design with characteristic Lamborghini features makes it instantly recognizable and aggressive yet elegant. Production is limited to just 63 units; you can get one now for $3.5 million. <br>
    <br>
       <b>5. McLaren Solus GT.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$3.6 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 5.jpg" alt="Img 5"><br>
    As one of the most elite sports car companies in the world, McLaren is known for pushing boundaries. Its latest contender is an exclusive, single-seater track monster called Solus GT. Interestingly, the car was first conceived in virtual reality and then materialized as a prototype. Borrowing heavily from the aircraft industry in terms of styling and aerodynamics, the Solus GT is powered by a naturally-aspirated 5.2-liter V10 engine which delivers an incredible 825 hp. All of this promises a Formula 1 type racing experience and fantastic driving features. Every one of the 25 units built will have a carbon fiber seat molded to its owner. Although the Solus GT is not road-legal, McLaren enthusiasts have shown a great deal of interest in what could be described as a low-flying fighter jet with wheels. <br>
    <br>
       <b>4. Koenigsegg CC850.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$3.65 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 4.jpg" alt="Img 4"><br>
    Do you remember when Koenigsegg introduced their first car in 2002? The CC8S was a pretty shocking model for the unknown brand when it arrived on the scene 20 years ago. Today, Koenigsegg is a household name in the hypercar sector and the company wanted to properly commemorate its humble beginnings with the introduction of the all-new Koenigsegg CC850, which draws inspiration from the car that started it all. The new model was the star of Monterey Car Week and features an engine from Jesko and a lot of unique technology and details. The 5.0-liter, twin-turbo V8 delivers 1,365 hp, but the real treat is a special 6-speed manual transmission that can also function as a 9-speed automatic. <br>
    <br>
       <b>3. Bugatti W16 Mistral.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$5 million <br>
    <img src="Car Img 3.jpg" alt="Img 4"><br>
    Besides the Chiron, Bugatti has introduced several breathtaking hypercars recently – all with very limited production runs, fantastic technology and power, and astonishing designs. Alas, there was one thing missing from Bugatti’s lineup. You’ve guessed it: a roadster. The exquisite, open-top model called W16 Mistral takes its name from the strong wind that blows in southern France and hints at a seductive open-air feel, which complements the incredible firepower from its W16 quad-turbo engine. Based on the Chiron, the W16 Mistral has an all-new body, details, and design, yet boasts the same 1,600 hp power output and drivetrain. <br>
    <br>
       <b>2. Pagani Huayra Codalunga.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$7.4 million <br>
    <img src="Car IMG 2.jpg" alt="Img 4"><br>
    In the late 60s, legendary sports car manufacturers, to make their cars more stable on the racing track, extended the bodies, creating Codalungas or “long tails”. Horacio Pagani wanted to revive this golden era of sports car racing with his latest creation, the Huayra Codalunga. This super-exclusive supercar is powered by a well-known V12 engine, with 851 hp propelling it to insane speeds. The aerodynamic package is improved thanks to the longer rear end, and it appears that the Codalunga is faster than the regular Huayra. However, it is much rarer, with just five cars scheduled for production. <br>
    <br>
       <b>1. Bugatti Centodieci.</b><br>
       <b>Price:</b>$13 million <br>
    <img src="Car Image 1.jpg" alt="Img 1"><br>   
    If you can speak Italian, then you’ll know that Centodieci means “110”. And if you know Bugatti’s history, then you’ll no doubt recognize this designation as the model name of the legendary Bugatti EB110 from the early 90s. The EB110 was the definitive supercar of its generation, and these are the heights that Bugatti wants to reach with this new version. Arguably, the manufacturer has accomplished just that with 1,600 hp behind the driver, a retro-futuristic design, and exceptional performance levels. Bugatti also deserves the accolade for the most expensive car of 2022, with the Centodieci being worth north of $13.1 million.
